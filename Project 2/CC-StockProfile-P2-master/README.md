C and C Investments

C and C Corner Investments is an application designed to allow users to easily create and manage their stock portfolios as well as examine their purchases by watching the changes of individual stocks. The key to the application is the real time updating IEXGroup API that offers access to real time updates of stocks and their relevant information. It also offers a simple user experience and interface that allows users to not only look at all current stocks on the market but buy and sell them all in a single page application. The main attraction here is the ease of use and in future iterations we can provide more detailed information simply by adding small changes to our views and manipulating the current functionality and configuring them for things like charts and news articles related to an individual stock. In its current form, users can look at their overall return on stocks and keep track of their transactional history letting them know specific returns at different purchase dates to keep up with the constantly changing stock prices.
